[![NuGet](https://img.shields.io/nuget/v/Vsxmd.svg?logo=NuGet&logoColor=white)](https://www.nuget.org/packages/Vsxmd)

A MSBuild task to convert [XML documentation](https://docs.microsoft.com/en-us/dotnet/csharp/programming-guide/xmldoc/xml-documentation-comments) to Markdown syntax. Support both .Net Framework and .Net Core projects.

## Features

- Provide full information from the XML documentation file.
- Provide easy reading facilities - parameter table, link tooltip, etc.
- Provide table of contents to type and member links.
- Highlight code block through `<code lang="csharp">` tag.
- Reference `System` types to official MSDN pages.

## Get Started

If you are using Visual Studio:

- In Visual Studio, right click project name to open project properties window.
- Switch to **Build** tab, in **Output** section, check **XML documentation file** checkbox.
- Install [Vsxmd](https://www.nuget.org/packages/Vsxmd/) package from NuGet.
- Build the project, then a markdown file is generated next to the XML documentation file.

If you are using Rider:

- Open the .csproj of your project
- Add `<GenerateDocumentationFile>true</GenerateDocumentationFile>` to the `PropertyGroup` section.
- Add `<DocumentationMarkdown>$(MSBuildProjectDirectory)\Readme.md</DocumentationMarkdown>` to the `PropertyGroup` section.
- Install [Vsxmd](https://www.nuget.org/packages/Vsxmd/) package from NuGet.
- Build the project, then a markdown file is generated next to the XML documentation file.

If you are using .Net Core CLI:

- Open project's CSPROJ file, declare [`DocumentationFile`](https://docs.microsoft.com/en-us/visualstudio/msbuild/common-msbuild-project-properties) property in `PropertyGroup` section. The path is relative to the project directory. [MSBuild Reserved and Well-Known properties](https://docs.microsoft.com/en-us/visualstudio/msbuild/msbuild-reserved-and-well-known-properties) are also available for this property.
- Run `dotnet add package Vsxmd` to install the the package to the project.
- Run `dotnet build` to build the project and generate the XML documentation and Markdown files.

## Vsxmd Options

There are some properties to customize the Markdown file generation process. They are all optional. If you want to use them, declare them in CSPROJ file's `PropertyGroup` section.

### `DocumentationMarkdown`

It is used to specify the generated Markdown file path. It defaults to the XML documentation file name with `.md` extension, under the same folder as the XML file. Similar to `DocumentationFile` property, the path is relative to the project directory and [MSBuild properties](https://docs.microsoft.com/en-us/visualstudio/msbuild/msbuild-reserved-and-well-known-properties) are available.

#### Example

```xml
<PropertyGroup>
    <DocumentationMarkdown>$(MSBuildProjectDirectory)\API.md</DocumentationMarkdown>
</PropertyGroup>
```

### `VsxmdAutoDeleteXml`

A boolean flag to delete the XML documentation file after the Markdown file is generated.

#### Example

```xml
<PropertyGroup>
    <VsxmdAutoDeleteXml>True</VsxmdAutoDeleteXml>
</PropertyGroup>
```

## Extend XML documentation

There are some extended features based on XML documentation. They are not described in [XML recommended tags](https://docs.microsoft.com/en-us/dotnet/csharp/programming-guide/xmldoc/recommended-tags-for-documentation-comments), but they are worth to use.

### Highlight Code Block

To highlight code block in the Markdown file, declare the attribute `lang` in `<code>` tag and set it to a program language identifier.

#### Example

```xml
<code lang="javascript">
    function test() {
        console.log("notice the blank line before this function?");
    }
</code>
```

## Programmatic API

This library provides the following programmatic API to convert XML documentation file to Markdown syntax programmatically.

- [Converter](https://github.com/lijunle/Vsxmd/blob/master/Vsxmd/Vsxmd.md#T-Vsxmd-Converter) : [IConverter](https://github.com/lijunle/Vsxmd/blob/master/Vsxmd/Vsxmd.md#T-Vsxmd-IConverter)
  - [string ToMarkdown()](https://github.com/lijunle/Vsxmd/blob/master/Vsxmd/Vsxmd.md#M-Vsxmd-IConverter-ToMarkdown)
  - [static string ToMarkdown(XDocument document)](https://github.com/lijunle/Vsxmd/blob/master/Vsxmd/Vsxmd.md#M-Vsxmd-Converter-ToMarkdown-System-Xml-Linq-XDocument-)

## Markdown File Demo

The best demo is this project's documentation file, [Vsxmd.md](https://github.com/lijunle/Vsxmd/blob/master/Vsxmd/Vsxmd.md). It is generated by this project itself.

## Known Issue

The syntax for the [`list`](https://msdn.microsoft.com/en-us/library/y3ww3c7e.aspx) comment tag is not well defined. It will be skipped during render. If you have ideas, please [open an issue](https://github.com/lijunle/Vsxmd/issues).

## Credits

This project is initially inspired from a [gist](https://gist.github.com/formix/515d3d11ee7c1c252f92). But in the later releases, the implementation is rewritten.
